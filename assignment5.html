         <td colspan="3">Four test models were printed before the final print. These were mostly smaller scale and of poorer quality to 
           print quickly. The largest was printed to scale to test the fit of the lamp innerd. The final print was done in two parts, the top and bottom halves. Each half took 19 hours to print.
           The outside of the lamp has some curious defects, but only on one side. I neglected to consider the infill pattern,
           and now think it may not have even been necessary though I like how solid and sturdy the lamp feels. An additional problem
           encountered was though the scale test print was a perfect fit, I forgot that the final print would have thicker walls. This led to 
           the space for the inner being too small in the final print. But rather than reprint it, it was easily fixed by sanding down the inner walls
           with a dremel. Despite these issues overall I'm very satisfied with the final result and love the purple glow, which the photos do 
           not do justice. </td>
